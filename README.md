# NJ Brew 

NJ Brew is a website that will house a collection of New Jersey craft beer breweries. Users will be able to create an account via the signup link in the navigation bar. Once a user signs in, they will be redirected to the homepage. The homepage will feature a random selection of three breweries. Users can select a brewery to access further details. Additionally, users can navigate to the Breweries page using the navigation bar, where they can scroll through the entire list of breweries. A search bar will be available for easy navigation. If a brewery is not listed, users can add it to the website.

## Future features to be implemented
 * A favorites button that will put that brewery in a user specfic favorites tab. (Please note the current favorites tab is not yet functional)

 * 1-5 star ratings and comment section with the Brewerys detail page.

 * Have the homepage pick random breweries based on ratings.

 * Footer link that will implement https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation API to direct users to a page that will list breweries outside of NJ. 

 * Change color of text to Primary for text inputs.
