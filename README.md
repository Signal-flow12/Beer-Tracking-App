NJ brew is a website that will house a collection of New Jeresey craft beer breweries. Users will be able to create an account via the signup link in the navigator bar. Once a user signed in they will be redicrected to the homepage. The home page will be a random selection of 3 breweries. A user can select a brewery to get further details. Users can also go to the Breweries page via the navigaton bar. Here user can scroll through the entire list of breweries. They will also have a search bar for ease of navigation. If there is a brewery that is not on the list the user can add it!
